**Title**: Shark On Wire 2

**Description**:
We found thisÂ [packet capture](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/b506393b6f9d53b94011df000c534759/capture.pcap). Recover the flag that was pilfered from the network.


**Steps Taken**:
Oh, boy! This was a tough one for me!

But, first as normal, go through the `capture.pcap`.
At first, nothing seems to make sense so I try to see `udp` packets since data within them can be easily read.

So, I apply filter:
```
udp
```

Next, let's also take into the filter, destination port of 22.
Done as:
```
udp && udp.dstport==22
```

Look at this for reference: http://sticksandstones.kstrom.com/appen.html

Now, I'm going to want to capture data in the form of the last three digits from the source port. For this I will use `tshark`.

First, use the following command to select the file and set the same filter that we did on wireshark as:
```
$ tshark -r capture.pcap -Y "udp && udp.dstport==22"
```

Let's use the awk command the print the `$2` i.e. is the second piece of text where all are separated by spaces which will select for example 5000 and then `substr` it to get everything after the 5 i.e. 000.
Done as:
```
$ tshark -r capture.pcap -Y "udp && udp.dstport==22" | awk '{print substr($2, 2)}'
```
![[Pasted image 20241225132505.png]]

Now, let's save this in a `tshark-filtered-data.txt` using the `>` command as:
```
tshark -r capture.pcap -Y "udp && udp.dstport==22" | awk '{print substr($2, 2)}' > tshark-filtered-data.txt
```

Now, we're ready to write a `bash` file. So, lets create a bash file called `extract-ascii.sh` and give it execute permissions:
```
$ touch extract-ascii.sh; chmod 744 extract-ascii.sh
```

Let's use the good old `vim` to create the bash as:
```
#!/bin/bash

# please note that any comment is explaining the command above it

while read -r line; do
        line=$(echo "$line" | sed 's/^0//')
        # Searches for any first 0's and removes them since when we convert the decimal
        # say 060 to hexa, it will get rejected due to the leading 0.
        # So, if 060 passes => 60. But if 112 passes => 112
        # cause it is only removing 1 zero at the beginning if any

        charac=$(printf "\\$(printf '%03o' $line)")
        echo "Character: $charac"
        # The above 2 lines convert the formatted string to hexa and directly
        # print it which gives us the actual character which is stored in the
        # 'charac' variable which when passed to echo prints it.

done < tshark-filtered-data.txt
# The '<' inputs the .txt where we stored the numbers to the who loop you just wrapped your head around.

Now, just read the output by running the file and the flag is yours to keep ;)
```
$ bash extract-ascii.sh
```

**Flag**: `picoCTF{P1LLf3r3d_data_v1a_st3g0}`

**Learnings**:
#### Creating a script

To create a script, simply run `touch <name-of-script>`
To recognise script as bash we need to add a shebang, which was `!/bin/bash` at the very beginning.
To execute it, simply run `bash <name-of-script>.sh`

#### `sed`

`sed` is a command line utility for text processing.
When I did `sed 's/^0*//'`:
- `^` ~ Asserts start of the line
- `0*` ~ Matches zero or more occurences of strings starting with 0
- `//` ~ is the replacement part, wherein if the '0' is removed then it is replaced by nothing
