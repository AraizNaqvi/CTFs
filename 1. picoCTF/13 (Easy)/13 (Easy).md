**Learnings**:
ROT13 is a cipher where each alphabet replaces its next 13th counterpart.
A becomes N, B becomes O and so on. 
The speciality of this cipher is that it encodes and decodes the same way cause there are 26 letters in the alphabet and 13 is half of that. So, simply decode it using ROT13 itself.
