**Title**: Let's Warm Up

**Description**:
If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?


**Steps Taken**:
Go to [link](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html?x=70) to convert `0x70` to decimal which turns out to be 112.

Now, if you check up reference tables of which letter resembles ASCII code of 112 as seen [here](http://sticksandstones.kstrom.com/appen.html).
It comes out to be `p`.


**Flag**: `picoCTF{p}`

**Learnings**:
I learnt that ASCII codes are decimal representations of certain characters.
All characters are represented with these.
