**Title**: The Numbers

**Description**:
TheÂ [numbers](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/f209a32253affb6f547a585649ba4fda/the_numbers.png)... what do they mean?


**Steps Taken**:
Open the image file using `xdg-open`:
```
$ xdg-open the-numbers.png
```

Upon looking at the numbers which at first seem completely random.
But there are two things to notice:
1. Presence of `{}` braces which resemble how the flag looks
2. The numbers don't exceed 26

Clearly, these numbers resemble the letters of the alphabet.
Went to `chatGPT` to get the numbers associated with each letter.

```
16 -> P
9 -> I
3 -> C
15 -> O
```

Aha! The flag is starting to form.
```
3 -> C
20 -> T
6 -> F
20 -> T
8 -> H
5 -> E
14 -> N
21 -> U
13 -> M
2 -> B
5 -> E
18 -> R
19 -> S
13 -> M
1 -> A
19 -> S
15 -> O
14 -> N
```

Hence, we've found the flag.

**Flag**: `picoCTF{THENUMBERSMASON}`

**Learnings**:
Nothing fundamental except understanding how to open image files right from the terminal. I used `xdg-open` to view the image.
